# Spin City Bike Shop â€“ Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and cost data from Spin City Bike Shop over two years (2021 and 2022). The goal is to evaluate business performance, uncover trends, and provide data-driven pricing recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server  
- Power BI  
- Excel  

## Datasets
The project uses three CSV files:
- `bike_share_yr_0.csv`: Sales data from 2021  
- `bike_share_yr_1.csv`: Sales data from 2022  
- `cost_table.csv`: Cost of goods sold (COGS) per year  

## SQL Query
Data was processed using the following SQL query:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_0
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_1
)
SELECT 
    dteday,
    season,
    a.yr,
    weekday,
    hr,
    rider_type,
    riders,
    price,
    COGS,
    riders * price AS revenue,
    riders * price - COGS * riders AS profit
FROM cte a
LEFT JOIN cost_table b
ON a.yr = b.yr;
Power BI Dashboard
Visualizations were created in Power BI to present key trends and insights.



Analysis and Insights
Revenue Growth: Revenue increased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by more riders and higher prices.

Profit Margins: Profit margins also improved. However, caution is advised with further price increases to avoid reduced customer demand.

Seasonality: Revenue and profit vary significantly by season, with peaks during warmer months.

Recommendations
A 10â€“15% price increase is suggested to test the market without risking significant loss of demand.

Consider segmented pricing for casual vs. registered riders.

Continue monitoring customer behavior and adjust pricing based on feedback and new sales data.

Conduct further market research to support long-term pricing strategy.

How to Run the Project
Download the dataset files: bike_share_yr_0.csv, bike_share_yr_1.csv, and cost_table.csv.

Import them into a SQL database (e.g., SQL Server).

Run the provided SQL query to calculate revenue and profit.

Import the results into Power BI to build dashboards and visualizations.
